# Polygenic_Resilience_Score_Pipeline
# Sample scripts for: 
1) genotype pre-imputation QC;
2) genotype post-imputation QC;
3) calculating principle components;
4) identifying individuals who were resilient to elevated polygenic risk;
5) genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis;
6) deriving and evaluating polygenic resilience scores using risk-residual genetic variants
